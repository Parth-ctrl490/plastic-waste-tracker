🌍 Plastic Waste Tracker

A smart and scalable solution to track, analyze, and mitigate plastic waste pollution using geospatial data, AI detection methods, and real-time hotspot mapping. Built as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, this project aims to empower citizens, organizations, and policymakers with actionable insights to fight plastic pollution.

✨ Features

📍 Plastic Waste Hotspot Detection – Visualize cities/regions with plastic waste severity levels on an interactive map.

🔍 AI-Powered Plastic Recognition – Detect and classify plastic waste from images (bottles, bags, wrappers, etc.).

📊 Data Dashboard – Track trends, severity levels, and statistics of waste across regions.

🌐 API + Web App – Flask backend with REST APIs, integrated with a lightweight frontend.

🛰 Scalable for Satellite/Drone Data – Extendable to use Earth observation data for real environmental monitoring.

🏗 Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-CORS

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (interactive map with Leaflet.js / Google Maps API)

Database: (Future) MongoDB / PostgreSQL for storing waste reports & analytics

AI/ML (Future Expansion): TensorFlow / PyTorch for image classification of plastic types

Deployment: Can run locally or deploy on cloud (Heroku / Render / AWS)

🎯 How It Works

Hotspot Mapping → Marks regions on a map with severity levels of plastic waste.

Backend API → Provides JSON data for waste hotspots (latitude, longitude, severity).

Frontend Visualization → Interactive web map color-codes severity (Red = High, Orange = Medium, Green = Low).

Scalability → Designed to integrate with real datasets, satellite images, IoT devices, or community reports.
